summary: "Hi, I'm Mike Oboryshko, a technical writer living in northern Delaware, near Wilmington. I started this site with several goals in mind. First, I wanted to be involved with github.io, and I knew that's where my online portfolio needed to be hosted. Second, I was looking for an better way to do single-source documentation (web and print outputs from the same source), and I had become tired of fiddling with XML-FO based solutions. And I wanted it to be open-source. So I came across jekyll, which is the native publication platform for GitHub. My intent is to use jekyll to set up my own production-ready single-source publishing platform, and also to experiment with other web technologies. I'll post about my technical projects, and my observations on life as a technical writer in the East Coat job market. If any interest develops I will add a comment feature."

## Greetings
Hi, I'm Mike Oboryshko, a technical writer living in northern Delaware, near Wilmington. I started this site with several goals in mind. First, I wanted to be involved with github.io, and I knew that's where my [online portfolio](../pages/general/portfolio.html) needed to be hosted. Second, I was looking for an better way to do single-source documentation (web and print outputs from the same source), and I had become tired of fiddling with XML-FO based solutions. And I wanted it to be open-source. So I came across jekyll, which is the native publication platform for GitHub. My intent is to use jekyll to set up my own production-ready single-source publishing platform, and also to experiment with other web technologies. I'll post about my technical projects, and my observations on life as a technical writer in the East Coat job market. If any interest develops I will add a comment feature.
