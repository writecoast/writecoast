<p>Hi, I'm Mike Oboryshko, a technical writer living in northern Delaware, near Wilmington. I started tech writing in NYC during the 1990s tech boom, when the industry was freely hiring English majors (like me) to write their user documentation. Eventually I moved to Delaware (where I grew up) to raise a family. The tech boom was accelerating, and in 1998 I set up as an independent consultant, right in time to work in a dot-com, and on a Y2K project. Along the way I became more knowledgable about the technologies and development process, and soon I found myself writing more technical documents aimed at developers or admins. Post-boom I found opportunities in start-ups and smaller entrepreneurial tech companies, where I was able to help develop and deliver their documentation plans. </p>

<p>The funny thing about living in Delaware is that I almost never worked for employers in the state. Delaware is small, and the northern tip of Delaware (where I live) is part of a four-state metro area that includes Philadelphia and its suburbs, and potentially even Baltimore. I've worked in Philadelphia and its suburbs, New Jersey, Maryland, NYC, and often remotely from home.  </p>

<p> Delaware officials tout the state's central East Coast location within easy reach of NYC and Washington DC. Local wags say the slogan is "Delaware - So close to where you'd rather be." In future posts, I'll write more about working as a Delaware-based tech writer.</p>

<p>I started this site with several goals in mind. First, I knew I needed to be involved with github.io, and I knew that's where my online portfolio needed to be hosted. Second, I was looking for an better way to do single-source documentation (web and print outputs from the same source), and I had become tired of fiddling with XML-FO based solutions. And I wanted it to be open-source. So I came across jekyll, which is the native publication platform for github. My intent is to use jekyll to set up my own production-ready single-source publishing platform. Here I want to give a shout-out to Tom Johnson of <a target="_blank" href="http://idratherbewriting.com">idratherbewriting.com</a>, who has done exactly that. I've never met Tom, but his published advice has been immensely helpful, and in fact the skeleton of this site is based on his site. Thanks, Tom!
